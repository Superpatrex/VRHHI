# VRHHI

## Overview

This Unity VR application simulates various visual impairments such as Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, Cataracts, and Macular Degeneration, as well as nervous system impairments like Peripheral Neuropathy and Parkinson's disease. The simulation is achieved by utilizing the passthrough feature of the Meta Quest 3 headset, augmented with the use of TES EMS devices controlled by a Raspberry Pi running a Flash web server. 

## Features

- **Simulation of Visual Impairments**: Experience how individuals with conditions such as Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, Cataracts, and Macular Degeneration perceive the world.
- **Simulation of Nervous System Impairments**: Understand the challenges faced by individuals with conditions like Peripheral Neuropathy and Parkinson's disease.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Seamless interaction with the simulation through the Unity VR application and control via the Raspberry Pi web server.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust simulation parameters to tailor the experience to specific impairment types and severity levels.
